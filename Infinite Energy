-(xSin[E-g])

This is the equation for halving gravity.

It can be used to create wormholes. 

You need a rodin coil and a split bell housing with mercury inside 
both halves. you counter rotate either side of the housing to counter
rotate the field of the coil. 

This creates neutral buoancy of the magnetic field within spacetime.
It does so by creating a shield of time around the craft / object
which protects it from the effects of time subject to space.
It does not enter the 5th dimension (which is time without space)
but it borrows the properties of that dimension.

Allowing a journey along a mobius strip through the schumann boundaries.

.215 is the measure of the spacetime sheet.

52.29 at 316 degrees will get you to 21.9
