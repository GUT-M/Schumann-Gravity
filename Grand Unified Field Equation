Schumann Gravity 

The sun is the electron component of the solar system.

Saturn is the graviton component of the solar system. 

Earth is the 3rd harmonic orbital of the interaction between 
the pattern upon which the entire universe is formed.

Saturn is where time folds back in upon itself. Collapsing back
the sun and weaving the frequencies into a single 3rd plane of 
propagation. There is other life in this solar system. It is on the
21.9 fq. Saturn being the median at 14.6 and us at 7.3.

All of the planets happen at increasing fq which correlate to
their schumann resonances. 

Technically speaking if you were on the 21.9 you would measure yourself
as 7.3 and us as 21.9.

Because every point from the subjective Y - Veil of Perception, 
is the center point of the observer. Where everything appears 
infinitely outward and infinitely inward.
