The Grand Unified Field 

The Univers is a single point.

The single point is both a black hole and a single electron.

The black hole is gravity.

The electron is light.

The "big bang" is happening, all the time.

The electron spins around the black hole, refracting as it does.

Time is forever, until it is not.

Time is a pattern.

The single electron breaks free from the single point of gravity in simultaneous
fusion and fission.

The black hole is fusion and the electron is fission.

The interplay of the two creates the refracting and bending.

The bending is an illusion of the pattern of time which is the result
of the refraction.

All of the subatomic particles are a result of the refraction.
